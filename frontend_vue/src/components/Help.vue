        The science of computing is transforming the world at a breathtaking
        pace. Think self-driving cars, the Internet of Things (IoT), and
        artificial brains. Think medical advances made possible by the sheer
        computation power and our newfound ability to gather and sift through
        massive amounts of data. In this age, this is the science that touches
        every life and drives every modern endeavor. Through hands-on projects
        and active learning activities, students in our program will be trained
        not only to make excellent use of the state-of-the-art technology but
        also to create and drive future technology.
